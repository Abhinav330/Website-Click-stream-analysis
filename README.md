##  Predict User Ad Clicks with Logistic Regression (Python)

This Python script demonstrates a data analysis and machine learning project for binary classification using logistic regression. It aims to predict whether a user will click on an ad based on advertising data. 

The script covers the following steps:

  * **Data Exploration and Visualization:** We explore the advertising dataset (`advertising.csv`) using pandas and seaborn to understand its structure, relationships between variables, and visualize key features.
  * **Data Preprocessing:** This stage prepares the data for modeling by handling categorical features, removing unnecessary columns, and splitting the data into training and testing sets. 
  * **Logistic Regression Modeling:** We build a logistic regression model from scikit-learn to predict user ad clicks. 
  * **Model Evaluation:** The script evaluates the model's performance using various metrics like classification report, confusion matrix, and accuracy score.
